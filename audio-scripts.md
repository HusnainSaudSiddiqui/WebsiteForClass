When we think about American wars, we remember the generals, the presidents, the battles. But what about the children? The twelve-year-olds working in factories while their fathers fought overseas. The teenagers in fields, keeping farms running. The young bodies that kept wartime economies moving, even as the nation claimed to be fighting "for the future."

This project asks a difficult question: whose childhood has been treated as expendable, and when does that finally change?

We'll explore two stories that might seem separate but are deeply connected. First, the history of child labor in America—in coal mines, textile mills, and fields—especially during wartime when production demands were highest. Second, how American foreign policy today still intersects with another form of child labor: children recruited into armed forces and groups around the world.

Both stories reveal the same pattern: when economic or strategic priorities collide with children's lives, too often, children become the flexible part of the equation.

Join us as we trace this history, from Lewis Hine's photographs that shocked a nation, to the New Deal reforms that promised protection, to the policy choices being made right now that determine which children are worth protecting—and which are not.

## 2. Photo Reflection Section (30-60 seconds)

Looking at this Lewis Hine photograph, I'm struck by how small the child appears next to the machinery. The child's hands are working, but their face—there's something in their expression that makes this real in a way statistics never could.

I notice the details: the worn clothing, the way they're positioned, the industrial setting that seems to swallow them whole. This isn't just a historical image; it's a moment frozen in time that forces me to ask: what was this child thinking? What were they feeling?

This photograph changes my understanding of "child labor" because it's no longer an abstract concept. It's a real person, a real body, a real childhood being shaped by work that should have been done by adults. The image makes the cost visible in a way words alone cannot.

## 3. Final Reflection Section (1-2 minutes)

After learning this history, I think the United States has a complex and urgent responsibility toward children in wartime, both at home and abroad.

At home, we've made progress. The Fair Labor Standards Act and other reforms showed that we can choose to protect childhood over production. But that protection isn't complete—agricultural work remains loosely regulated, and enforcement gaps still exist.

Abroad, the responsibility is even more complicated. The Child Soldiers Prevention Act exists on paper, but when waivers are used almost automatically, it becomes clear that strategic interests are still being prioritized over children's lives. If we truly believe that no child should be a soldier, then our policy should reflect that—not just in words, but in action.

The pattern I see is this: we protect children when it's convenient, when it doesn't conflict with other priorities. But real responsibility means making children's protection non-negotiable, even when it's difficult, even when it means saying no to allies or changing how we think about security.

The question isn't whether we have responsibilities—we do. The question is whether we'll finally treat those responsibilities as more important than the excuses we've used to avoid them.

## Recording Tips:

1. **Speak clearly and at a moderate pace** - Not too fast, not too slow
2. **Use natural pauses** - Let important points sink in
3. **Vary your tone** - Show emotion where appropriate, especially in the reflection sections
4. **Record in a quiet space** - Minimize background noise
5. **Do multiple takes** - Record each script 2-3 times and choose the best version
6. **Save as MP3** - Use the filenames specified above and save in an `audio/` folder
